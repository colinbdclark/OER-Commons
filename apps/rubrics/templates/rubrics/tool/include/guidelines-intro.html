  <a href="http://achieve.org" target="_blank">Achieve</a> has developed a series of rubrics for this tool to help gauge various aspects
  of quality, allowing an additional filter for sorting and another way to discover OER.
  These kinds of ratings are essential, especially for states and districts
  looking to recommend specific OER to their teachers.

  This tool requires the input of knowledgeable and experienced teachers and
  administrators to evaluate these resources to, in turn, help educators use
  them. Please take the time to evaluate this resource in full for the future
  benefit of these educators and their students.
