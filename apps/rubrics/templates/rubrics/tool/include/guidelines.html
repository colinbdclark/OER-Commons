    Achieve has developed a series of rubrics for this tool to help gauge various aspects
    of quality, allowing an additional filter for sorting and another way to discover OER.
    For example, these rubrics enable ratings of the quality of content explanation and
    assessment. These kinds of ratings are essential, especially for states and districts
    looking to recommend specific OER to their teachers.

  <ul>
    <li>Before assessing the alignment of OERs to standards, you should have
      access to the Common Core State Standards (CCSS). These can be found at
    <a href="http://www.corestandards.org" target="_blank">www.corestandards.org</a>.</li>
    <li>The rubrics are intended to be applied to the smallest, sensible unit.</li>
    <li>Each rubric should be scored independently of the others; you may apply
      up to 7 rubrics to an OER.</li>
    <li>Mark “N/A” on any rubric that doesn’t apply to the resource you are evaluating.</li>
    <li>Your review of an object is complete once the ratings are submitted
      through the “Finalize OER Review” button at the bottom of the
      “Opportunities for Deeper Learning” rubric.</li>
    <li>By using this tool, you agree to license all of your content and
      comments to the public domain.</li>
  </ul>
