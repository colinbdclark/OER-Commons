    <li>Before assessing the alignment of OER to standards, you should have
      access to the Common Core State Standards (CCSS). These can be found at
    <a href="http://www.corestandards.org" target="_blank">www.corestandards.org</a>.</li>
    <li>The rubrics are intended to be applied to the smallest, meaningful unit.</li>
    <li>Each rubric should be scored independently of the others; you may apply
      up to 7 rubrics to an OER.</li>
    <li>Mark “N/A” on any rubric that doesn’t apply to the resource you are evaluating.</li>
    <li>Your review of an object is complete once the ratings are submitted
      through the “Finalize OER Review” button at the bottom of the
      last rubric.</li>
