    <li>Before assessing the alignment of OERs to standards, users should have access to the
    Common Core State Standards (CCSS). These can be found at
    <a href="http://www.corestandards.org" target="_blank">www.corestandards.org</a> the-standards.</li>
    <li>There are five possible ratings within each rubric: Superior, Strong, Limited, Very Weak,
    or N/A.</li>
    <li>Each rubric should be scored independently of the others.</li>
    <li>Users can apply up to 7 rubrics to an OER.</li>
    <li>Mark “N/A” on any rubric that doesn’t apply to the resource you are evaluating.</li>
    <li>Most of the rubrics can be applied across content areas and object types, but Rubric VII
    currently applies to mathematics.</li>
    <li>A user’s review of an object is complete once the ratings are submitted through
    the “Finalize OER Review” button at the bottom of the “Opportunities for Deeper
    Learning” rubric.</li>
    <li>All user data generated is CC BY.</li>
